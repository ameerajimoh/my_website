Data Analytics for Finance: A Spark of Curiosity
Taking the course on Data Analytics for Finance using RStudio was a turning point for me. As someone already familiar with financial concepts, I was intrigued by the idea of using data analytics to analyze, clean, and interpret financial data. RStudio provided a powerful platform to manipulate and visualize data, giving me a glimpse into the possibilities that lay ahead.

Data Science in Business: Unleashing the Full Potential
Motivated by my initial experiences, I eagerly enrolled in the elective course on Data Science in Business. The course description alone ignited my excitement as it promised to equip me with advanced skills and frameworks. From sourcing and managing large datasets to exploring machine learning techniques and working with geospatial data, the course offered a comprehensive toolkit for data analysis and interpretation.

Excitement and Future Applications
The concepts and skills I gained from the Data Science in Business course left me truly exhilarated. The ability to source, process, and visualize complex data sets, combined with machine learning techniques, opened up endless possibilities for extracting valuable insights. Additionally, the course's emphasis on building interactive web applications using Shiny apps allowed me to communicate and share my findings effectively.

Looking Ahead: Real-World Application
As I near the end of my journey at LBS, I am eager to apply the knowledge and skills I've acquired in the world beyond academia. I am excited to utilize data analytics techniques to analyze financial concepts, perform predictive modeling, and make informed decisions based on data-driven insights. Furthermore, the ability to work with geospatial data and develop interactive web applications will enable me to communicate complex ideas in a visually engaging manner.
