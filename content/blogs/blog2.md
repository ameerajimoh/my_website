title: Spanish Learning Journey at LBS
---

Learning Spanish during my time at the London Business School (LBS) was an exciting adventure that enriched both my personal and professional life. In this blog, I will share how interactive classes with just three other students allowed me to immerse myself in the language and explore the vibrant Spanish-speaking world.

Interactive Learning:
At LBS, our Spanish classes were anything but ordinary. With a small class size, we had ample opportunities to engage in interactive conversations, debates, and exercises. Our native Spanish instructor encouraged us to practice the language in real-life scenarios, creating an engaging and immersive learning environment.

Cultural Immersion:
Learning a language is more than just grammar and vocabulary; it's about embracing a culture. Alongside our language lessons, we immersed ourselves in the rich Hispanic culture. From exploring literature and art to attending cultural events, we gained a deeper appreciation for the Spanish-speaking world.

Practical Application:
Our interactive classes extended beyond the classroom. We actively sought opportunities to practice our skills in authentic settings, such as ordering food at local restaurants or conversing with native Spanish speakers during our travels. This practical application enhanced our learning and boosted our confidence.

Learning Spanish at LBS had a profound impact on my personal and professional growth. It expanded my network, bridged cultural gaps, and fostered meaningful connections. Additionally, my language skills became a valuable asset in the business world, opening doors to international opportunities and collaborations.
